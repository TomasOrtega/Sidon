\chapter{Basic Sidon sets results}

\begin{definition}[Sidon set]\lean{IsSidonSet}\leanok\label{def:sidon_set}
    A set $S \subseteq M$, where $M$ is an additive commutative monoid, is called a Sidon set if for all $a, b, c, d \in S$, then $a + b = c + d \implies \{a, b\} = \{c, d\}$, that is, there are no repeated sums.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\lean{empty_is_sidon}\leanok\uses{def:sidon_set}
    The empty set is a Sidon set.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\lean{singleton_is_sidon}\leanok\uses{def:sidon_set}
    A singleton set is a Sidon set.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\lean{sidon_subset_is_sidon}\leanok\uses{def:sidon_set}
    If $S$ is a Sidon set and $T \subseteq S$, then $T$ is a Sidon set.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}\lean{sidon_set_size_bound}\leanok\uses{def:sidon_set}
    If $S$ is a Sidon set in a finite additive commutative group $M$, then $|S| \cdot (|S| - 1) \leq |M|$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let $S = \{a_1, \ldots, a_n\}$. Consider the differences $a_i - a_j$ for $i \neq j$.
    Since $S$ is Sidon, theses differences are unique, and there are at most $|M|$ of them.
    By injectivity, the proof follows.
\end{proof}
